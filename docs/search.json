Mapas de distribución geográfica de Odonatos de Europa a partir de Atlas de distribución y bases de datos online.\nDocumento elaborado durante las Prácticas curriculares del Grado de Biología, URJC, realizadas en el Departamento de Biogeografía y Cambio Global, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (CSIC), de Enero a Abril de 2020.\nEl objetivo principal de estas prácticas curriculares externas es desarrollar mapas de distribución de las especies de odonatos de Europa a partir de varias fuentes de información. Además, una vez homogeneizada la información y obtenidos dichos mapas, agregar su información para generar un mapa de riqueza de especies."

Previously, I worked as a data scientist in the energy sector, and I have academic backgrounds in Biology from URJC, a Master’s in Ecology from UAM, and a Master’s in Data Science and Business Analytics from IMF Smart Education.\nMy passion for research, particularly in biogeography, ecology, and data science, stems from my childhood. Additionally, I strongly believe in the importance of science communication. Without effectively sharing knowledge with the public, scientific advancements lose their impact. That’s why I’ve been contributing to the science communication blog Ecotoxsan for several years. Now, I am excited to embark on my own blog.\nThanks for reading!"

    "text": "Gómez-Vadillo, M., Mingarro, M., Ursul, G., & Wilson, R. J. (2022). Assessing climate change exposure for the adaptation of conservation management: the importance of scale in mountain landscapes. Land, 11(11), 2022.\nVulnerability of mountain ecosystems to climate change depends on the capacity of topographic variation to provide heterogeneous microclimates and rates of climatic change. Accurate methods are therefore needed to assess climate at spatial resolutions relevant to ecological responses and environmental management. Here, we evaluate a mechanistic microclimate model (30 m resolution; Microclima) and mesoclimate data (1 km; CHELSA) against in situ temperatures, finding that both capture (whilst somewhat underestimating) variation well in observed ground-level maxima along a mountain ridge in 2011-13. We apply the models to estimate ecological exposure to recent temperature changes for four mountain areas of the Iberian Peninsula, based on analogous and non-analogous monthly maxima in 1980–1989 versus 2010–2019. The microclimate model revealed fine-resolution exposure to non-analogous conditions that were concealed in mesoclimate data, although whether exposure was greater at the micro- or mesoscale (and hence the types of organisms or management decisions affected) depended on the topographic context of each mountain range. Habitat type influenced microclimatic exposure, and hence may provide opportunities for conservation adaptation. These results suggest that mechanistic models are potentially useful tools to assess exposure to climate change at spatial resolutions that permit understanding and management of biodiversity responses in mountain ecosystems."
